# GoatRide

GoatRide is a college-focused ridesharing platform designed to make coordinating simple, reliable, and social. Founded at WPI, we make it easy for college students to create, discover, and join rides while automatically managing availability and participation.

Years ago, campus ridesharing was nothing more than a corkboard in the student center where drivers could post notes advertising a ride. Most colleges have gotten rid of this, but the problem of getting home over break or around town still exists for many students. Nowadays, campus ridesharing often relies on group chats. GoatRide centralizes this process by providing a dedicated system for organizing rides, tracking availability, and reducing friction in day-to-day transportation within a university community.

The application was built by students using Next.JS and TypeScript, with Prisma for database management and BetterAuth for secure user authentication. GoatRide is designed to be lightweight, predictable, and easy to maintain, with a responsive interface that works well across desktop and mobile devices.
